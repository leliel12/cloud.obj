It is that simple.\r\n\r\n### But again, how? \r\nCloud.obj, as a server, just exposes modules.\r\nThen, as a client, it maps them to urls, exposing classes, methods, properties.\r\nFinally, you can use it and interact like any regular module!\r\n\r\n### Give me some code!\r\n\r\n```\r\n#A simple, example\r\n\r\nimport cloud\r\no = cloud.Obj(\"http://localhost:5555/sys\") # Now o is the module sys, from remote\r\nprint \"The path is \", o.path","tagline":"One Object to rule them all","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
