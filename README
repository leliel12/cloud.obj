=================================
CLOUD.OBJ
     Objects in the cloud
=================================

- How many times do you think that getting data from web sites / cloud apps is way too difficult?
- How many times do you think that, even with webservices, you need to handle oscure libraries or data formats (XML, JSON, etc)?
- How many times do you think, can't I just use it, with not intermediate steps? (like, learning the api, handling SOAP, REST, etc)
- How many times do you think, could not it be easy?? could it not be simple???

YES. IT CAN BE SIMPLE.

Cloud.obj, as a server, just exposes methods like any normal class, but in a new style webmethod.
Then, as a client, it maps this method to a class.
Finally, you can use it and interact like any regular class!

=================================
A practical example:
=================================

This is a Python Class:

  >>> book = Books()

  >>> print book.getauthor("The Shinning")
  Stephen King

  >>> book.add("Fake book", "Tom None")

  >>> print book.getauthor("Fake book")
  Tom None

This is a Cloudee web class:

  import cloudobj

  >>> book = cloudobj.get('http://www.site.org/Books()')

  >>> print book.getauthor("The Shinning")
  Stephen King

  >>> book.add("Fake book", "Tom None")

  >>> print book.getauthor("Fake book")
  Tom None
