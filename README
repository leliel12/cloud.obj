=================================
CLOUD.OBJ
     One object to rule them all
=================================

- How many times do you think that getting data from web sites / cloud apps is way too difficult?
- How many times do you think that, even with webservices, you need to handle oscure libraries or data formats (XML, JSON, etc)?
- How many times do you think, can't I just use it, with not intermediate steps? (like, learning the api, handling SOAP, REST, etc)
- How many times do you think, could not it be easy?? could it not be simple???

YES. IT CAN BE SIMPLE.

Cloud.obj, as a server, just exposes methods like any normal class, but in a new style webmethod.
Then, as a client, it maps this method to a class.
Finally, you can use it and interact like any regular class!

Give me some code!

# A simple, example

import cloud

o = cloud.Obj("http://localhost:5555/sys") # Now o is the module sys, from remote

print "The path is ", o.path
